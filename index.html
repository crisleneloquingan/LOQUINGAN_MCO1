            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am Crislene Gacoscos Loquingan from Banay, Sta. Cruz, Ilocos Sur. I am 22 years old and I was 
                born on the 25th of July, 2002. I am the 2nd eldest child and the eldest daughter of Cesario Cabato Loquingan Sr., a 
                carpenter and a farmer and Veronica Gacoscos Loquingan, a housewife. My siblings are Vince, the oldest and 
                graduated taking up Bachelor of Science in Criminology in NICOSAT Colleges and currently working as a collector in 
                Card, Inc. Cesario Jr., currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Mechatronics in ISPSC Santiago Campus. Ian, a Grade 
                11 student (GAS student). Clarisse, a special child particularly a Down Syndrome who has linguistic impairment. 
                Michal, the youngest and a Grade 5 student. I also have a step brother named Gabriel Gacoscos.</p>
            
            <p> At the age of 4, I started studying as a Daycare student at our barangay plaza. At that time my 
                father got sick and nearly died. Grateful always to the Lord that he gave him another life. I was my fathers’ favorite 
                before yet everything changed as I grew up. When I was in grade 1 and 2, I studied in Banay Primary School and my 
                teacher was Mrs. Josefina Acosta. I competed with other schools in terms of academics when I was in grade 2. 
                Though me and my 2 other classmates did not win, it’s still a nice and amazing experience for me. When I was 
                already in grade 3, I had to transfer to another school since there was only one classroom for grade 1 and 2 available 
                at Banay Primary School during that time. I then studied at San Jose Elementary School until I finished in grade 6. I 
                am a shy type of student and every time my teachers call my name to recite in front of my classmates, I always cry in 
                front of them in the middle of my presentation. I graduated in Elementary as the top 7 and best in Math.</p>
            
            <p> On April 20, 2014, at the age of 11, I left my family to study at The Sisters of Mary of Banneux, 
                Inc. (Girls town) located in Biga II, Silang Cavite, where everything is provided for free and I’ve got to meet a lot of 
                people from different places in Luzon. Upon going, I was too excited yet upon arriving, my tears started to fall and 
                badly wanted to go home but my mother sisters won’t allow me to go home. I have no other choice but to stay and 
                always remember that it is for me, my family and for the betterment of my future. So, I stayed there for almost 6 
                years without gadgets, money, and without communications to the outside world. I can only see and talk to my 
                family during our 2 weeks vacation and during visiting day on the first Sunday of September. It was hard being away 
                from my parents at a young age and it’s hard to obey or follow the rules and regulations of the school but because I 
                enjoyed the company and motivations of my helping-sister, mother sisters, friends, dorm mates, classmates and 
                teachers, I stayed and always wanted to return after our vacation in order to continue what I have started. I was in 
                grade 7 when I learned how to use the high speed sewing machine and also learned how to sew uniforms, shorts, 
                bags, skirts, and many more. It was also the time I started to develop my skills in playing basketball. When we are 
                given free time on Sundays, my dormmates and I always play basketball in one of the 32 courts inside the campus. 
                When I was in grade 12, I’ve got my first NC2 in Technical Drafting. During my OJT, I worked at Sy On garments 
                company together with my 49 batchmates. We are being paid at a round 7,000 pesos every 15th and last day of the month. On June 12, 2019, it’s a holiday yet we have work but it was one of my unforgettable memory inside the 
                company. I hid the pair of shoes of one of my linemates. When it’s time to go home already she asked me if I hid her 
                shoe but I lied and told her I did not. She then went home barefooted. The next day, my other line mates heard about 
                what happened, and they scolded me and I am thankful that they did not tell our supervisor about it or else I will be 
                sent back to the school and worst case, I cannot graduate. I worked there for seven months and on the last day of 
                August, 2019, I and my batchmates finally bid our goodbyes to the company and to our work mates. We then return 
                to our school and wait for our graduation day which is on September 04, 2019. After graduation, my father fetched 
                me to go home here in Ilocos. I’m always grateful to the Lord for sending Ven.  Aloysius Schwartz to be his instrument 
                in founding the Sisters of Mary and Brothers of Christ. I’m grateful to my mother-sisters and teachers, who served as 
                my second parents, and taught me how to pray, value time, obey, and many more. Grateful to my dorm mates, 
                classmates, batchmates, and friends who became part of my life and served as my siblings. And lastly, I am grateful to 
                the benefactors, donors, and friends of Fr. Al that keeps on helping and giving what they can in order for the 
                institution to continue to serve the poorest of the poor. </p>
            
            <p> March 13, 2020, I returned to my beloved school together with my friend and other batchmates 
                to get our requirements for enrolling in college. It’s also the time when lockdown started so when I arrived home, I 
                got quarantined at home for 2 weeks. On May 28, 2020, I got myself into an accident, I fell in the creek riding a single 
                motorcycle. I’ve got stitches in my head which served as a memory that once in my life I committed a mistake in 
                riding the single motorcycle. At the opening of classes, I enrolled at the ISPSC Tagudin campus taking up a Bachelor of 
                Science in Business Administration major in Financial Management but 1 week passed and I quit. I left in all our 
                group chats and did not have the proper dropping of my subjects. My parents later found out about it and asked me 
                why? I told them that I find it hard. The next school year, I still did not enroll though they wanted me to enroll 
                already. Now, I am already in 3rd year college and my friends and other batchmates have already finished their studies 
                and some are already working. My friends always tell me “Naududi ka man ngem dumteng to latta, aganos ka lang”.  </p>
